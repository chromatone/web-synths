Please consider helping if you can: patreon.com/WebSynths\\n\\n- You can use your QWERTY keyboard, mouse, mobile touch or MIDI keyboard to play the sounds.\\n-  You can change the tuning of the keys, or select a scale, by clicking the tuning button.\\n-  MIDI is a way to use an external physical instrument to play it. If you have a MIDI keyboard that you wish to use, hit the MIDI button to set it up.\\n- If a note gets stuck, hit the panic button, it will stop all voices from playing.\\n-  You can use the arrows on your computer keyboard to scroll through the presets.\\n\\nA simple explanation of Subtractive Synthesis:\\n\\n- Subtractive Synthesis works by taking one or more oscillators, setting the pitch of their oscillation (usually to the note of the key being pressed,) setting the shape of their oscillation to the desired timbre (Sine, Saw, Square or more complex shapes,) mixing them together and running them through a filter to change their EQ (usually filtering out the highest or lowest frequencies... this is why it is called \\"subtractive\\"), then running them through an envelope so the note can be heard on when a key is pressed down and is silenced when the key is released. In the case of WebSynths Microtonal, the sound is then sent through effects like delay, chorus and reverb and out to your speakers.\\n- Oscillators are the voices. This synth has 3 of them in the left column. You can change the character of each voice by changing the parameters of them. The 'Shape' menu allows you to choose from different styles of voice for each oscillator. You can turn each voice on or off and mix them together.\\n- The filter section applies equalization to your oscillators via the cutoff and emphasis controls. You can change the equalization filter type to 'low pass / high pass' and many more. You can use the LFOs and/or Envelopes to change how the filtration changes over time. An LFO is just a slow oscillator that is uses to automatically move a parameter over time.\\n- The amplitude envelope changes how your sound is played, volume-wise, when you hit a note. For example, having a long release time will mean that once you let go of the note you are playing it will tail off until fading out. Having a slow attack will mean that your note will fade in instead of playing at full volume straight away.\\n- The effects section allows you to add various effects to your overall sound. You can change the effects, mix them together and toggle them on or off too.\\n\\n","iframe":false,"cover":"ffc54664-7ba4-4855-a56a-6657a5542a04","id":10,"sort":13,"clicks":172,"public":false,"is_new":false,"playtronica_compatible":null,"stats":[11]},{"url":"https://stuartmemo.com/synth/","date_created":"2023-10-27T12:45:54.586Z","title":"Sympathetic Synthesizer System Mk 1","slug":"sympathetic","author":"Stuart Memo ","author_link":"https://github.com/stuartmemo","description":"The Sympathetic Synthesizer System Mk 1 is an interactive web app that emulates a complex synthesizer.

Loading external modules clearly goes against this idea.\\nNot to mention being open-source, otherwise we are at the mercy of the wishes of a company for what we can and cannot do, which is not something Cardinal's authors wish to abide by.\\n\\nA self-contained plugin can't be overstated, as DLL/shared-object symbol conflicts can trigger hard-to-debug crashes.\\nWhile Rack tries to mitigate this as much as possible, crashes due to conflicting modules have already been seen in v2 builds.\\nOn the other side, Cardinal redefines class and function names as needed to avoid as many conflicts as possible.\\n\\nSupport for ARM and non-mainstream platforms (for example BSD) has also always been missing from the official Rack since the start.\\nWhile we can patch the Rack free version to support these, same can't be done with Rack Pro with it being a closed-source product.\\nThe online library/store only supports a very specific set of platforms too, so non-supported platforms would need any 3rd-party modules to be manually compiled to make them usable.\\n\\nUnhappiness with the audio threading behaviour of Rack also plays a role.\\nBoth audio and MIDI should be locked to the host audio thread as to minimize (or even altogether remove) latency and jitter.\\nThe use of separate threads for MIDI is bad design, one that has been corrected in DAWs and JACK-MIDI for several years...\\nBut Rack's use of RtMidi requires separate threading, so Cardinal does not use it.","iframe":true,"cover":"dc7070e1-66fd-4f74-95d2-92d8388864e2","id":56,"sort":18,"clicks":5,"public":false,"is_new":true,"playtronica_compatible":null,"stats":[48]},{"url":"https://multiplayer-orchestra.com","date_created":"2024-04-23T08:07:22.796Z","title":"Multiplayer Orchestra","slug":"multiplayer-orchestra","author":"Mutli_Orchestra","author_link":"https://twitter.com/Mutli_Orchestra","description":"Play in real time with people from all around the world with more than 400 instruments.","tags":["Poly","MIDI","Keyboard","Collaborative","Online"],"archive_link":null,"archive":false,"content":"Multiplayer Orchestra ([https://www.multiplayer-orchestra.com/](https://www.multiplayer-orchestra.com/)) is a web application that allows you to virtually collaborate with musicians from around the world in real-time.

The piano roll is essential to the sequencer, which is on the left of the screen, with 72 notes from C2-B7 (labelled differently from a piano, C2 on the sequencer corresponds to C1 on a piano). In addition to several parameters which can be modified to change the sound of the music, additional functionality can be accessed via the console.\\n\\nUpon opening the site, users can begin composing and \\"drawing\\" notes on the grid, with the default instrument being Electric Piano. By default, a sequence's time signature is set to 4/4, and the grid spacing is set to 1/4 (16 notes per measure). The note lengths can be adjusted by dragging the dark tab on the right of each note, and precision can be afforded by changing the 'Grid' option to other note divisions. \\n\\n## History\\n\\nOnline Sequencer was created on January 2, 2013 by Jacob Morgan during a break at Georgia Tech.\\n\\nBeginning in the fall of 2013, accounts were available but were separate from the music portion of the site. They were only used in the forum and the website chat.\\n\\nIn 2015, accounts were linked to the main website and allowed songs to be saved under someone's username.\\n\\nThe World Update in 2018 added several new instruments and changed the landscape of sound design on the site. The \\"World Update Contest\\" was held for the update.\\n\\nStarting in late 2020, OS began to receive a variety of updates which vastly improved the functionality of the site. These updates introduced features like custom grid sizes, automation with markers, extra reverb options, detune, and distortion. In 2021, the \\"Space Race\\" contest was held, as to see who could work best with the changes.\\n\\nIn late 2022, newer, higher-quality instruments were added. Some of the instruments, such as Electric Piano, Grand Piano, Violin, and Cello got an updated sustained version, while the original versions still exist under the \\"classic\\" designation.\\n\\nCurrently, the 10-Year Anniversary Contest is being held.\\n\\n## Features\\n\\nWithin the editor, numerous user interface features allow for various changes which will impact the individual sequence on that page.\\n\\n### Basic features\\n\\nUI features include:\\n\\n- Tempo (10-999 BPM)\\n- Measure count or Time count (MM: SS.ssss)\\n- Time signature (2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 5/4)\\n- Grid size (This correlates to note divisions; 1/16, 1/12, 1/8, 1/6, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2)\\n- Auto Scroll (Fast, Smooth, Off; how the sequencer displays measures off-screen as a sequence plays)\\n-  Add an Audio Track (This won't be saved to the sequence but will play alongside it for ease of transcription)\\n-  Title input\\n-   Draw, select, and erase\\n-   Instrument dropdown, instrument options, and select instrument (selects all notes of the current instrument)\\n-  Select all, Cut, Copy, and Paste\\n-  Zoom options\\n-  Export options\\n-  Help\\n-  Fullscreen\\n- Tooltips\\n\\n### Advanced features\\n\\nUsers can access more advanced features for use in their sequences by clicking the advanced tab on the instrument they wish to change. This menu contains options to change volume, panning, detune (-1200 to +1200), reverb, distortion, and an equalizer. This array lets users configure specific instruments to create specific sounds, and textures, or to accompany other instruments as a layer or development of the original sound.\\n\\nOS also allows for commands to be entered in the browser console to manipulate different options in specific ways, such as setting custom to detune values (0-infinity), custom grid sizes, note divisions, and sequence ID amongst other things. These options bring OS closer to that of classic Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) but are still limited in terms of accessibility and availability.\\n\\n### Browser and device support\\n\\nOnline Sequencer supports Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers, such as Microsoft Edge, Opera, and Brave. Firefox is also supported, but often with limited functionality. Safari and Internet Explorer are not supported, due to engine issues.\\n\\nOther mobile browsers support sequence playback, but not editing. However, iOS users have the same problem with WebKit on macOS. However, unlike in macOS, all browsers (even Chromium-based browsers) use WebKit as the engine for iOS due to Apple prohibiting other engines for security reasons; iOS does not support Online Sequencer, other than chat and forums.\\n\\nThe website's user interface is formatted for proper use on desktops, but some pages such as the chat page, playlists, and forums should be formatted well on mobile devices.

Billard is a webapp that never repeats itself. It generates music automatically based on the collisions of balls in a 2D space. Collisions trigger notes (or chords) in a given key. One can add balls or move them (y-position is pitch); the app remembers its state between reloads; or it can be reset with the 'init' button on the top left. Gravity can be adjusted in real time to change the behavior of the balls.\\n\\nIt owes a lot of inspiration to Brian Eno and Erik Satie (inventor of musique d'ameublement, or \\"furniture music\\"). Some may think the lack of pattern makes it not musical enough -- but this lets it be listened to —and watched— for a while without boredom.\\n\\nThe webapp is made using plain JavaScript. (All SVG icons were made 'by hand'.) It uses Tone.js only for triggering piano samples.

This approach can also be used to explore and experiment with polyrhythms, syncopation, and beat construction.\\n","iframe":true,"cover":"8c7eac07-92d5-4c10-bb3f-e44d6a36a4af","id":63,"sort":51,"clicks":2,"public":false,"is_new":true,"playtronica_compatible":null,"stats":[55]},{"url":"https://perso.numericable.fr/olivier.friker/synth/O3-synth%20V1.3.html","date_created":"2023-10-27T12:45:54.069Z","title":"OLIF SY1K","slug":"olif-sy-1-k","author":"Olivier Friker","author_link":null,"description":null,"tags":null,"archive_link":null,"archive":false,"content":null,"iframe":true,"cover":"3b9a5e11-3de3-46fe-9cdc-e1668b152f31","id":13,"sort":52,"clicks":145,"public":false,"is_new":false,"playtronica_compatible":null,"stats":[37]},{"url":"http://www.noisesculptor.com/","date_created":"2023-10-27T12:45:54.104Z","title":"Note Sculptor","slug":"note-sculptor","author":"Ruin Technology","author_link":null,"description":null,"tags":null,"archive_link":null,"archive":false,"content":null,"iframe":false,"cover":"a01968d1-3f88-4522-9752-1c33d10d90d9","id":15,"sort":54,"clicks":129,"public":false,"is_new":false,"playtronica_compatible":null,"stats":[38]},{"url":"https://zya.github.io/granular/","date_created":"2024-07-29T17:37:33.497Z","title":"Multi-Touch Granular Sampler","slug":"granular","author":"Zya","author_link":"https://github.com/zya/","description":"The demo is a granular synthesiser with multi-touch support which uses Web Audio API for sound sampling and Processing.js for drawing and interactivity.","tags":["Granular"],"archive_link":null,"archive":false,"content":null,"iframe":true,"cover":"f44fa962-37f0-487d-b69b-6880dd06dbd1","id":61,"sort":55,"clicks":1,"public":false,"is_new":false,"playtronica_compatible":null,"stats":[53]},{"url":"https://aikelab.net/websynthv2/","date_created":"2023-10-27T12:45:54.141Z","title":"WebAudioSynth V2","slug":"web-audio-synth-v2","author":"like","author_link":"https://github.com/aike/","description":null,"tags":null,"archive_link":null,"archive":false,"content":null,"iframe":true,"cover":"ac668fba-7226-43dc-a91f-bd21a31446e5","id":16,"sort":56,"clicks":305,"public":false,"is_new":false,"playtronica_compatible":null,"stats":[39]},{"url":"https://isleoftune.com/","date_created":"2023-11-25T06:22:15.184Z","title":"Isle of Tune","slug":"isleoftune","author":"Jim Hall","author_link":"https://twitter.com/isleoftune","description":"Draw an island, where everything plays music.","tags":["game","sequencer"],"archive_link":null,"archive":false,"content":null,"iframe":true,"cover":"6830c24f-c7bf-430f-abc1-3d7fbf5f2557","id":46,"sort":57,"clicks":15,"public":false,"is_new":false,"playtronica_compatible":null,"stats":[40]},{"url":"https://choptop84.github.io/abyssbox-app/","date_created":"2025-01-29T17:14:36.989Z","title":"AbyssBox","slug":"abyss-box","author":"choptop84","author_link":"https://choptop84.github.io/","description":"AbyssBox is a mod of BeepBox developed by choptop84 and UltraBox is a mod of BeepBox developed by Main and Neptendo.","tags":["DAW","FM"],"archive_link":null,"archive":false,"content":" AbyssBox is a Modification of Ultrabox by choptop84, Ultrabox is made by Neptendo and Main, with assistance from community members!\\nUltrabox takes elements from most of the beepbox mods available (see credits) and puts them in one convenient package.\\n\\nAbyssBox adds many improvements to the UI for both PC and Mobile. Over 20 themes, and 5 layouts! Plus many more other miscellaneous changes that improve the user experience. Though that isn't all AbyssBox adds. There are many more changes and improvements all over the app.\\n\\nAll song data is contained in the URL at the top of your browser. When you make changes to the song, the URL is updated to reflect your changes. When you are satisfied with your song, just copy and paste the URL to save and share your song!\\n\\nThough you should instead click 'File' and then 'Shorten Song Url', it makes the link more managable!\\nInstructions\\n\\nYou can add or remove notes by clicking on the gray rows at the top. AbyssBox automatically plays the notes out loud for you. Try it!\\n\\nNotes go into patterns, and you can edit one pattern at a time. Those numbered boxes at the bottom of the editor are the different patterns you can edit. Click the boxes to move to a different part of the song, or click the arrows on the currently selected box to swap which pattern is played during that part of the song.\\n\\nAbyssBox can play several rows of patterns simultaneously, and each row has its own set of patterns. Most rows can play melodies or harmonies, but the bottom row is for drums.\\n\\nAll song data is contained in the URL at the top of your browser. When you make changes to the song, the URL is updated to reflect your changes. When you are satisfied with your song, just copy and paste the URL to save and share your song!\\n\\nWhen AbyssBox has focus (click on its interface above), you can use these keyboard shortcuts:\\n\\n- Spacebar: play or pause the song\\n- Shift Spacebar: play from mouse location\\n- Z: undo, Y or Shift Z: redo\\n- C: copy pattern from selection\\n- V: paste pattern into selection\\n- 0-9: assign pattern number to selection\\n- Arrows: move selection\\n- Ctrl + Arrows: rearrange channels\\n- [ ]: move playhead backward or forward\\n- F/H: move to First or Highlighted pattern\\n-  Shift & Drag: select part of a pattern (long press on touch screen)\\n-  These are just a few shortcuts, check AbyssBox's edit menu for more!\\n\\nIn the note pattern editor, you can click and drag horizontally on a note to adjust its duration. You can also click above or below an existing note to add more notes to be played simultaneously, which is called a chord.\\n\\nADVANCED: Drag vertically from an existing note to bend its pitch, or drag vertically from above or below the note to adjust its volume. You can perform fine volume adjustment if you hold Control while doing this!\\n\\nADVANCED: Click and drag on the pattern grid to make a selection. You can then press C/V to mass copy/paste parts of your song.\\n\\nAbyssBox has many more features. Try playing with the buttons and menus on the right side to find out what it can do! You can also click on the label next to each option for a description of what it
