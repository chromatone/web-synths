It combines music and physics into a unique creative tool, as I explore various unconventional methods for generating music.\\n\\nMost traditional music composition tools revolve around the idea of a repeatable pattern. Billard is a webapp that never repeats itself. It generates music automatically based on the collisions of balls in a 2D space. Collisions trigger notes (or chords) in a given key. One can add balls or move them (y-position is pitch); the app remembers its state between reloads; or it can be reset with the 'init' button on the top left. Gravity can be adjusted in real time to change the behavior of the balls.\\n\\nIt owes a lot of inspiration to Brian Eno and Erik Satie (inventor of musique d'ameublement, or \\"furniture music\\"). Some may think the lack of pattern makes it not musical enough -- but this lets it be listened to —and watched— for a while without boredom.\\n\\nThe webapp is made using plain JavaScript. (All SVG icons were made 'by hand'.) It uses Tone.js only for triggering piano samples. Beyond piano, it's MIDI-enabled and works well at slow speed with haunting, dark synth sounds.","tags":["MIDI","Poly","Physics","Sequencer"],"archive_link":null,"archive":false,"iframe":true,"cover":"b56f4acb-b528-4d18-a3b5-405fb10cafa4","id":59,"sort":49,"clicks":2,"public":false,"is_new":true,"playtronica_compatible":null,"stats":[51]},"relativePath":"biliard/index.md","filePath":"[slug]/index.md","lastUpdated":1745422496000}`),d={name:"biliard/index.md"},v=Object.assign(d,{setup(p){const{params:e,frontmatter:m}=i();return(u,h)=>{const t=a;return s(),n("div",null,[o(t,r(l(c(e))),null,16)])}}});export{y as __pageData,v as default};
